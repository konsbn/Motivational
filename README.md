Motivational Sayings Generator
===============================
The idea for this script is to generate motivational sayings.
To do this I attempt to collect data from Reddit's 'Get
Motivated' subreddit, store it in a database, and parse back the
results. Another future edit will be to use motivational and
inspiring works found on Project Gutenberg, and other sites, to
generate sayings. 

Please let me know your thoughts and if you have some other ideas for
how to do this...most helpful are thoughts around using Python's
NLTK capabilities.
